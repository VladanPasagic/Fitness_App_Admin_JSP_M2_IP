# JSP M2 Application (Admin Panel Implementation)

## **Overview**
The **Administrator Application** uses **JSP M2** to manage the fitness systemâ€™s data. This is the backend administration interface for handling categories, users, and statistics.

### **Functionality**
1. **Category Management (CRUD)**:
   - Admins can create, read, update, and delete fitness categories (cardio, strength, etc.).
   - Specific attributes for each category (e.g., equipment, type of exercises) are managed here.

2. **User Management (CRUD)**:
   - Admin can add new users, modify existing ones, and delete them as needed.

3. **Statistics**:
   - Displays logs of the fitness application, which include user activity and errors.

### **Implementation**
- The application is developed using **JSP M2** for managing data flow and UI rendering.
- Use standard Java technologies such as **Servlets**, **JSP**, and **JDBC** for database interaction.
- Ensure the interface is user-friendly and follows standard web design principles.
